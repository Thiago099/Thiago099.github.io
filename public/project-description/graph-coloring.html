    This algorithm employs a strategic selection process, identifying the most suitable node to initiate the coloring sequence. Building upon this foundation, it extends color assignment to neighboring nodes, all while prioritizing the optimal nodes first. This cascading approach streamlines the coloring procedure and yields exceptional results.
