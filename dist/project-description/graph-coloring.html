    This is a graph coloring algorithm that uses a estimation of the number of odd loops a certain node belong to color the graph
</p>
<p>
    This make sure that when saying that a node needs a color, you are optimizing the number of colors needed
</p>
<p>
    It picks the best node to color, and from that node it goes to its neighbors, but setting the best nodes first
